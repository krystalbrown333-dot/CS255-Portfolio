# DriverPass Portfolio Reflection

The DriverPass project was created for a client who wanted a system to help students prepare for their driving tests. The system provides online training for the written exam, scheduling for driving lessons, and tools for instructors, secretaries, and administrators to manage accounts and track progress. Together, the business requirements document and the system design document demonstrate my ability to collect requirements from the customer and design a system that meets those needs.

One area I did particularly well was documenting clear business requirements and translating them into system functions. My attention to detail ensured that each requirement was tied to a user role and system capability, which made the design more practical and aligned with the client’s expectations.

If I could revise one part of my work, I would improve the clarity of my use case diagram. The text was difficult to read, and I would enlarge the labels and simplify the layout to make it more accessible to non-technical audiences. This change would strengthen the presentation and make it easier for senior leaders to understand the system at a glance.

I interpreted the user’s needs by focusing on the different roles (students, instructors, secretaries, administrators) and mapping their tasks into system functions. Considering user needs is critical because it ensures the system is usable, efficient, and aligned with real-world workflows. Without this focus, the system might meet technical goals but fail to serve the people who rely on it.

My approach to designing software involves gathering requirements, identifying user roles, and creating diagrams to visualize system interactions. In the future, I will continue using techniques such as UML diagrams, iterative design, and stakeholder feedback to refine system analysis and design. These strategies help ensure that the final product is both technically sound and user-friendly.
