Summary of the DriverPass Project

DriverPass is a proposed online platform designed for a driving school that needed a more efficient way to manage lesson scheduling, training packages, and student progress. The client wanted a system that would allow students to register, purchase packages, schedule appointments, and access online learning materials, while instructors could manage availability and track student activity. The goal was to replace outdated manual processes with a modern, user‑friendly system.

I did particularly well in organizing the system requirements and translating them into clear, structured diagrams. My documentation was consistent, detailed, and aligned with the client’s goals. I also created a clean repository structure with professional README files, which makes the project easy to navigate and understand.

If I could revise one part of my work, I would refine the class diagram to better show the relationships between system components, especially around scheduling and user roles. Adding more detail to the attributes and methods would make the design even more realistic and implementation‑ready.

I interpreted the user’s needs by focusing on the problems they were trying to solve: scheduling conflicts, lack of online resources, and inefficient communication. I implemented these needs by designing features such as online scheduling, role‑based access, automated notifications, and centralized training package management. Considering user needs is essential because a system must solve real problems and be intuitive for the people who rely on it. A design that ignores user needs will fail, even if it is technically sound.

When designing software, I begin by understanding the problem and gathering clear requirements. I use techniques such as use case analysis, UML diagrams, and iterative refinement to break the system into manageable parts. In the future, I plan to continue using structured documentation, visual modeling, and user‑centered design strategies to analyze and design systems. These approaches help ensure that the final product is functional, maintainable, and aligned with user expectations.
